During my last three months of college, I built a bike. Starting off by learning the intricacies of sizing and refining bike geometry in [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6afd9109843e2963423853ec/w/bd0d625c6e67c8762b4695a9/e/fd534489982f63e20685585b), I mastered brazing and tube-notching so that I could turn a box of steel tubes into a bike frame:

Next, I rode my existing $40 craigslist bike all over Boston to pick up discount components to build out my touring bike. The paniers were hand-me-downs from my father who toured throughout Europe when he was my age.

During the days leading up to graduation, it was anyone's guess whether or not I would finish this bike. After walking across the stage for graduation, I went straight to the bike room and continued throwing components onto my frame. __I affixed the last piece about an hour before the school kicked us out of the dorms__, so with trepedation, I packed all my possessions into my paniers and rolled off campus. Lacking a test run, the first few miles were terrifying and I expected each bump to break everything. Gradually gaining my trust, my bike valiantly carried me all the way to the other coast without a single major mechanical malfunction.
