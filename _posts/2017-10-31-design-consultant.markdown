Since 2015, I have been doing freelance design work. This work experience has taught me some valuable tools:
- __Communicate efficiently__ and clearly with clients to ensure that everyone is always on the same page.
- __Predict costs__ for preliminary quotes. I have always landed within 10% of my predicted price tags.
- Work quickly and manage time to consistently __deliver ahead of schedule__.

If you need a life-sized Alice (in wonderland) falling down your spiral staircase for a themed party, I can do that. Want a sign for your bar that makes patrons think they are in the wild west? Done.

What if you want a doorway in your house to look like a keyhole? I can do that too. On the left is a digital render of what my client and I agreed would meet the design constraints, and on the right is the delivered product.
