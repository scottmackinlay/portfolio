__My team designed and prototyped the stage in the above video__

Alice Sheppard is a wheelchair dancer and she came to Olin with an unusual challenge. Could we make her a stage that would enable her to showcase the unique beauty of wheelchair dancing. Also, could we do it __in three weeks__?

We quickly learned as much as we could from interviewing Alice and conducting codesigns to explore her vision of the ideal stage. Next, we physically prototyped ramps in order to get her feadback on key parameters like slope, friction, length, and awesomeness. After __many rounds of prototypes__ (and a few all-nighters), we ultimately arrived at a stage that looks like this:

### Process

Because we wanted to "skin" the surface of the stage with flattenable plywood sheets, we were constrained in the shapes that we could create. After talking with some math professors, it turns out the surfaces we were looking for are described as having zero gaussian curvature. To design these special surfaces, I __taught myself Rhino__ (a computer aided design software) with a powerful mathematic plugin called Grasshopper. Using these tools __we found a shape that met the constraints from Alice, math, and fabrication.__ 

The stage we ultimately created was a huge success: Alice loved it, and she immediately began choreography of her latest piece, Descent, that is currently being performed around the world.
