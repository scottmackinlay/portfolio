Over the years, I’ve picked up a bit of music production gear, so to hold/transport it all, I fabricated an enclosure. Using CNC-routed “Hammerhead” joinery and in-line butterfly clasps, I made the perfect container. The interior foam has the profile of my equipment cut into it to ensure a snug fit.

This piece showcases my self-driven attention to detail and my fabrication ability.
