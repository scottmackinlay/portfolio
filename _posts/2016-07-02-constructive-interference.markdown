In the summer of 2016, I worked with Plebian Design and Hypersonic on this piece for installation at Oregon State University. Made from __1500 pounds of laser cut steel__ hung in front of a stenciled wall pattern, Constructive Interference generates a mesmerizing moire effect as the observer walks by. My role on this piece was to generate the cut-sheets for the steel panel and the vinyl stencil. Using a combination of Processing, Rhino-Grasshopper, and Python, I took the equipotential lines of a two-source electromagnetic system and projected those lines through a curved surface. The result was a pair of designs that were very similar to each other but varied slightly (to create the moire effect).

Next, __I interfaced with steel fabricators to create optimal cut-sheets of the pattern__. Ultimately, I broke the pattern into 20 pieces that could fit on their own steel sheets for the laser cutter. To get the complimentary pattern on the wall, I designed and cut my own vinyl stencils that could be used to facilitate the painting process.

The installation process of this piece was an epic two weeks of little sleep and intense fun. Our small team of four put up a gigantic dust shield all around our work site (complete with fans to maintain negative pressure). Next, we assembled the steel puzzle pieces and welded them together so that we could treat the metal for the corroded patina. After the wall was modified, stenciled, and painted, the steel was hung and the piece was complete.
