I am a passionate [musician and DJ](https://soundcloud.com/scottmackinlay/dj-project-week-two), so when my mechatronics class tasked me with making a __rotary haptic response device__, I immediately knew that I wanted to make a haptic turn table. Unlike the vinyl turntables of old, this device was modeled after the form factor of modern CDJ's. 

The focus of this project was to:
- Lean to write and embed C for a __PIC microcontroller__
- Implement control schemes that create various __haptic responses like virtual springs/dampers__.
- Design a robust and gorgeous __physical prototype__
