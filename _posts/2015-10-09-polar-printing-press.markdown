At the intersection of __mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering__ is this our new spin on printing. Instead of the lame cartesian printers that dominate %99.99 of the market, we opted for the challenge of creating a poster printer that could operate in polar coordinates.

The major learning that occured on this project included:
- __Ideating__ innovative and creative projects
- Constant __integration__ of substantial electrical, computer, and mechanical sub-components
- Designing on a __$200 budget__
