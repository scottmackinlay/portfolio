### For as long as I can remember, I've spent my time exploring, learning, and making things. 

I'm most happy when I'm using my unique talents to solve difficult, important problems. Sometimes those problems are as simple as how to find the bus to Damnoen Saduak before the sun goes down. Other times it's less concrete like: how can I make something that simultaneously inspires and informs the viewer. No matter what problems I'm solving, I have an ever-growing set of tools that get me where I need to be. Over the past four years, I have been focusing on honing these skills in the realm of engineering and design as a student at Olin College and during summer internships.

Prototype-test-iterate is the name of the game and I've come to love the incremental progress that this mentality has brought to even my most ambitious projects. Currently, I am seeking new arenas to apply these skills in a way that can help the world. If you like my work and want to see the difference I can bring to your company, shoot me an email. If you want to join my new band, or go backpacking/bike touring you should also hit me up.
